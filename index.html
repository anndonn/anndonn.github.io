<h1> Unit Two </h1>
<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p> Website one: <a href="http://www.vogue.com">vogue.com</a> <br>
Website two: <a href="http://mishanonoo.com/">mishanonoo.com</a></p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.vogue.com">Vogue.com</a> demonstrates great balance and hierarchy: The Vogue logo is the largest on the page making it the focial point of the page. The large logo draws your eye to the center of the page, leading to a flow to the equally spaced and sized content below. The content demonstrates and effective use of the grid system, as each block of content is equally sized and spaced between four columns.<br>
<a href="http://mishanonoo.com/">Mishanonoo.com</a> has a more simplistic and intriguing design. The site features two large dominate images that are both focal points of the page. The Nonoo logo is smaller, keeping the focus and interest on the two images. This focused interest effectively draws the viewer in and invites them to click and scroll over the two images. When scrolled over, the images become interactive and display more about the designer.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Both sites are visually heavy and demonstrate a clean grid system. Vogue has a more straight-forward navigation bar, while Nonoo forgoes this feature to create more disruption and interest in the images on the page. Vogue's page offers more content to the viewer; Nonoo's page offers a display of the designer's vision rather than a surplus of content.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Homepage One</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0052.jpg" width=400>
<p>About Sketch: This layout would utilize a grid with 3 columns. Everything would be centered on the page, with the logo being the focal point. This would then establish a hierarchy, as the logo would draw the eye of the viewer first, then they would naturally flow to the smaller and evenly spaced and sized content below.</p>
</li>
<li> <strong>Homepage Two</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0053.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This option has a more interactive element, as there would be a scrolling bar of content as the focal point of the page. The logo has been moved to the upper left corner, to keep the viewer focused on the content displayed. The page is balanced by the top navigation bar spanning across the top of the page.</p>

<li> <strong>About One</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0054.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This version goes along with the first version of the homepage layout. This would still be in a 3-column structure, but with only the middle column holding content. This use of negative space will draw the viewers eye to the cotent, and keep the overall layout clean and simple.</p>
<li> <strong>About Two</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0055.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This version is similar to the first, however, this option utlizes more of the horizontal space on the page. The copy section has been moved next to the main image, and the logo again has been made smaller, making the content the focal point.</p>
<li> <strong>Portfolio One</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0058.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This version also uses a 3-grid structure. Within this structure, the logo is still the largest element on the page and centered, making it the focal point. The 3 columns of information are uniform in how they display information, keeping the page balanced and making it easier for the viewer to flow through the information.</p></li>
<li> <strong>Portfolio Two</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0059.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This option is similar to the first, but more minimal. Instead of displaying the copy and descriptions for each portfolio piece, this option would hide it until the viewer clicks on the corresponding image.</p>

<li> <strong>Contact One</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0056.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This option utilizes a 2-grid layout, with equal content in both grids. This equality keeps the layout balanced. The logo is also the largest on the page, creating a focal point in the hierarchy.</p></li>
<li> <strong>Contact Two</strong><br><img src="images/IMG_0057.jpg">
<p>About Sketch: This option keeps the contact content centered and largest on the page, making it the focal point. The message box is the largest feature, therefore directing users to use it.</p></li>
